# WGS Extract Betav2b Français Language Patch File Instructions

Overlay the [Français patch file](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/blob/master/WGSExtractv2b_Francais_Patch.zip) onto your
current [WGS Extract Betav2b release from 18 February 2020](https://WGSExtract.github.io/). 
For those desiring a Français language interface to the tool. This provides a new **wgsextract.py** file to replace your existing one to enable
a Français language selection (along with the existing Deutsch and English).  And a new Français language strings file.

1. Click [here to download the Français patch file](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/blob/master/WGSExtractv2b_Francais_Patch.zip).
1. Go to your Downloads directory and unzip the archive folder you just downloaded (if not done for you already).
2. Drag the folder / directory "programs" to your **WGSExtract** program top-level install folder / directory.  There should be a "programs"
folder there already. You may get a message about overwriting an existing **programs/wgsextract/wgsextract.py** file.  Say yes to replace it.

When you start **WGS Extract**, you should now have a Français language option available to select.
