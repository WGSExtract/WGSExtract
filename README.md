# WGS Extract Development
>Note: This repository is woefully out of date.  Use the release packages as they contain a complete copy of all build and release files needed to create a new release. See the latest-release JSON file for the URLs to the 6 packages.

This is the main **WGS Extract** Developers repository and support area for coders and others with a deeper understanding of the tool.  Beside the actual code repository that can be git cloned to your development desktop, there are additional documentation and build areas.  See the **WGS Extract** [Developers' Wiki](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/wiki/) for more information.

See [WGS Extract Users](https://wgsextract.github.io/) for the main entry point for users. That is where to download a release and find documentation related to using the tool. 

See also [WGS Extract Historical](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Historical "WGSE Historical") for an archive of the original work and tool in 2019 by Marko before others started to get involved and help build on his initial body of work.

Within this area are the source code, build scripts and developer documentation for the tool. Including historical release notes.
