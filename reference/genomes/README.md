The **Reference Genomes** subsystem of WGS Extract v3

For the current, initial **Beta v3** release, see the two files **get_reference_genomes.sh** and **process_reference_genomes.sh**.  Both called from the **Installer** or run locally by a user to provide the ten (10) pre-defined and built in reference genomes for the **WGS Extract v3** systems.
